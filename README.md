# Custom Desktops
Run your app on custom desktop.

### Overview
Custom Desktops is a template which allows you to run the program on independent desktop. A user who is working with the program,
has no access to other Windows programs. No start menu, no taskbar, no desktop icons - nothing, except your application.  
Just add global extension to your apps, that's all.

### Examples
- Standard People app (examples\people): just run the exe and see how it works.
- More interesting example: [customizable shell](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fk0r16y7ag9digq/AAD65G1RtyBVQJxDOMh0NfV1a?dl=0). Download all, go to Shell folder and run CustomShell.exe.
